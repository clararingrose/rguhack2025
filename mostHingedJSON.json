For example you can apply for things like food, heating costs, nappies, toiletries and travel.• Community care grants - to help people to settle in a new home, when moving from an \"unsettled way of life\" (for example hospital, prison or a homeless accommodation unit). They can also support families who are facing exceptional pressure. For example you can apply for things like furniture or carpets.We award grants based on your situation. We only receive a limited amount of money from the Government each year, so we can only provide small grants. We normally cannot give you more than 3 grants in any 12 month period unless there are exceptional circumstances.",
